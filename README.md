# The King's Missing Page
"The King's Missing Page" is a point and click animated adventure game written for the 2020 js13kGames contest.

You control Detective Pip who has been given the assignment of finding the King's missing page boy, who went missing in the woods whilst delivering a message for the King. 

Explore 31 locations and discover over 20 characters and 18 items. 

Works on desktop and mobile. Since the game is predominantly built using Emojis, it looks quite different on different platforms. Works well on Windows, Mac, and Android, but for the best visual results, try it on a MacBook or recent Samsung phone.

# Controls
Control Pip by using the Walk to, Look at, Pick up, and Talk to icons at the bottom of the screen.

It's a classic Point and Click adventure game interface.

**Walk to:** Used for moving around and to enter buildings.

**Look at:** Used for examining an item or something in the current scene.

**Pick up:** Used for picking up items that you find.

**Talk to:** Used for talking to other characters in the game.

You can also use the items in your inventory by clicking on them and then clicking on the thing you want to use it on.
